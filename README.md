# Project Breadfish

The continuation of our contest-winning game ai

## Introduction

Back in 2015, I enjoyed a software competition at the University of Kiel.
We needed to build an artificial intelligence that plays the board game *Hey, thanks for the fish!* against others.
Our bot called *Breadfish* turned out to be very successful and we managed to win the finals against 400 competitors.

As you can see in the [project repository](https://github.com/jvpichowski-projects/cau-software-challenge-2015-submission) we were using a highly optimized iterative deepening alpha-beta search with a unique feature set.

After five years of absence, it is time to revive the project with an artificial intelligence-based on new concepts.
Back in the days, we named our ai Breadfish after the song about [the marvellous breadfish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RpdPzJgaBw). 
Now it is time to go to the next step and build the [Marvellous Breadfish AI](https://github.com/jvpichowski-projects/marvellous-breadfish-ai).
Stay tuned for a new attempt on fishing on ice floes.

Of course, I need to rebuild the [game server](https://github.com/jvpichowski-projects/hey-thanks-for-the-fish) because the competition servers went offline a long time ago.

## Project Structure

The project contains of the following three submodules:

* [cau-software-challenge-2015-submission](https://github.com/jvpichowski-projects/cau-software-challenge-2015-submission) This is the original Breadfish bot submitted in 2015. It is the baseline for new experiments.
* [hey-thanks-for-the-fish](https://github.com/jvpichowski-projects/hey-thanks-for-the-fish) This repository contains the game server which is rebuild from the remaining documentation of the original game server.
* [marvellous-breadfish-ai](https://github.com/jvpichowski-projects/marvellous-breadfish-ai) This is our newest attempt on solving this challenge with the use of new ai concepts.

## State

At the moment, we are working on replicating the game server.
